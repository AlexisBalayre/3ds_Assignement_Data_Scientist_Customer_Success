tkt_013,Auto topic renaming not working for new conversations,Aura used to automatically rename each conversation with a topic pulled from the original request. April 23 is the most recent date where it auto renamed. Everything since is 'New conversation'. Is this change intentional?,2024-05-24 08:00:00,2024-05-27 10:00:00,"The 3DSwym patch delivered on May 27 resolved the issue for new conversations. Auto-renaming now works again, but existing 'New conversation' topics remain unchanged.",usr_006,usr_009,sts_006,pri_002,cat_002
tkt_014,Aura fails to answer even if correct source is shown,"Asked Aura a question and received a standard response that it couldn't answer. However, the correct answer was present in the second source link provided.",2024-05-29 09:00:00,2024-06-02 11:00:00,"Aura retrieves and processes content in chunks. Even if the correct article appears in the sources, the relevant chunk may not have been retrieved. This can result in the LLM not seeing the needed information. Additionally, issues such as unfamiliar terminology and conservative confidence thresholds may affect whether a response is generated.",usr_010,usr_005,sts_002,pri_002,cat_002
tkt_015,Data ingestion delay in AURA for public and custom tenants,"How quickly does AURA ingest new data sources for a user in a public tenant? A newly created document titled 'Quintiq AWS & Containers' was not found by AURA, and the response referenced a different, irrelevant document.",2024-05-30 10:00:00,2024-06-03 14:00:00,"Content ingestion from the public tenant can take up to 5 days due to moderation and backup processes. For private tenants, AURA retrieves content only from the current user's tenant, the public tenant, user documentation, and a subset of KB entries. Team-specific tenants outside of internal or public ones are not indexed as data sources.",usr_007,usr_009,sts_002,pri_003,cat_002
tkt_016,Does AURA support retrieval from attached files?,"Can AURA retrieve information stored in files (e.g., PDFs, Word documents, images) attached to posts or wikis? If so, what file formats are supported? If not, is support for this planned? Also looking for a list of supported sources.",2024-06-02 10:30:00,2024-06-02 16:00:00,"Currently, AURA supports limited retrieval from PDF files attached to posts or wikis. Other formats like Word documents and images are not supported at this time. Retrieval effectiveness depends on content structure and specificity. RAG improvements are expected in upcoming releases such as FD03. Further details are available in the document 'Understanding AURA: Agents, RAG, and What’s Really Happening'.",usr_008,usr_009,sts_002,pri_002,cat_002
tkt_017,Why AURA cannot manage complex prompts?,"Attempted to use a structured, instruction-heavy prompt to retrieve detailed information about an Abaqus keyword (*AMPLITUDE). AURA failed to respond correctly, while another model ('Le Chat') did. This raises questions about AURA’s ability to manage complex prompts, intent detection, and the role of agents and vector retrieval in RAG pipelines.",2024-06-02 17:30:00,2024-06-03 11:30:00,"AURA's handling of complex prompts is limited due to its reliance on a RAG pipeline with predefined instructions. Even if a prompt contains structured guidance, the model may not follow it unless intent detection routes the query to a suitable agent. In this case, the expected 'chitchat' or technical expert agent was not triggered. Improvements to intent detection and agent handling may enhance prompt interpretability in future updates.",usr_005,usr_009,sts_002,pri_003,cat_002
tkt_018,How will AURA be licensed to customers?,Looking for details about AURA's licensing model and cost structure as it prepares for public release in 2025x FD03. No official information seems available yet. Is pricing or access method confirmed?,2024-06-03 14:00:00,2024-06-03 14:30:00,Licensing details for AURA are still under discussion at the executive (XCOM) level and have not yet been finalized. More information is expected closer to the 2025x FD03 release.,usr_004,usr_009,sts_005,pri_002,cat_003
tkt_019,Languages supported by AURA for translation,"Observed that AURA failed to correctly translate Mandarin into English, returning an unrelated Czech phrase. Need clarification on which languages AURA supports for translation, and how to avoid translation errors—especially when relying on memory and rephrased queries in ongoing conversations.",2024-06-03 15:00:00,2024-06-03 15:45:00,"Translation issues are often linked to the memory-based rephrased query step in ongoing conversations. This can lead to unexpected outputs, especially when combining translation tasks with context reuse. To reduce errors, start a new conversation. AURA translation is expected to improve in future releases.",usr_006,usr_009,sts_005,pri_002,cat_002
tkt_020,Why is Aura retrieving outdated sources and using irrelevant agents?,"Asked Aura a simple holiday-related question and received an irrelevant 'funny' response from the chitchat agent. Follow-up attempts returned outdated posts from 7 years ago, missing more relevant and recent wiki pages. Why wasn't the correct 2025 holiday media file retrieved, and why does Aura rely on old data or fail to use full context?",2024-06-03 16:30:00,2024-06-03 17:10:00,"The chitchat agent was triggered by mistake due to a failure in intent detection. Improvements are planned to restrict this agent to only when explicitly appropriate. Regarding RAG, the system sometimes surfaces older posts due to their embedding similarity scores. Currently, wiki pages and media files may not be indexed or prioritized in the same way as posts. Enhanced document parsing and source relevance scoring are expected in future versions to resolve these issues.",usr_003,usr_009,sts_005,pri_003,cat_002
tkt_021,3DSwym sources – quality and manipulation safeguards,"Questions raised regarding data quality and safeguards within AURA's retrieval mechanism. Since AURA uses internal and authorized external tenant content (like technical documentation), concerns emerge when internet content is manually copy-pasted into Swym posts or wikis. How is controversial or external content detected, labeled, or excluded? Can AURA be manipulated by content injection, and are there best practices to avoid it? Are there mechanisms to mark sources as disputed or trace origin (e.g., to the web)?",2024-06-03 18:00:00,2024-06-03 18:30:00,"Currently, AURA cannot automatically distinguish between original and copy-pasted internet content unless explicitly marked. Best practices encourage users to avoid verbatim reposting and to add contextual analysis. The risk of content injection is limited by ranking mechanisms and statistical thresholds, but it is not eliminated. Future roadmap includes traceability tags for external sources and support for restricted agents using scoped content via communities and tags to reinforce control and reliability.",usr_007,usr_009,sts_005,pri_003,cat_002
tkt_022,Why does AURA generate inconsistent code for similar prompts?,"Tested AURA's ability to generate SweeT JSON and HTML code based on field inputs. Initial responses were encouraging, but follow-ups led to inconsistent formatting, truncated responses, or no replies. Discrepancies include missing schema definitions, varied field structures, improper syntax, and inconsistent recognition of input types. This raises concerns about prompt interpretation stability and limitations in generation length or token context.",2024-06-03 19:00:00,2024-06-03 19:30:00,"AURA's generative behavior is inherently probabilistic, and variations in response are expected. Inconsistent outputs may result from context window limits, incomplete retrieval, token truncation, or subtle prompt wording differences. Some issues stem from fallback behaviors when sources are missing or confidence is low. AURA currently lacks persistent memory and advanced tool integration for deterministic code generation but improvements are expected in future updates to stabilize formatting and extend output.",usr_008,usr_009,sts_005,pri_003,cat_002
tkt_023,How to prevent AURA from retrieving other tenant data?,"After enabling AURA in a team-specific tenant, it was observed that AURA retrieved content from the external public platform (https://r1132100503382-eu1-3dswym.3dexperience.3ds.com/), even though no internal source content had been added yet. This raised concerns about cross-tenant data retrieval. Is there a way to restrict AURA to only tenant-specific data sources?",2024-06-03 20:00:00,2024-06-03 20:20:00,"By design, AURA includes public User Advocacy communities and User Documentation as globally available data sources across all tenants. This is expected behavior and does not represent a security issue. At this time, there is no tenant-specific toggle to exclude public content. However, such configuration options may be considered in the future for increased data scope control.",usr_010,usr_009,sts_005,pri_002,cat_002
