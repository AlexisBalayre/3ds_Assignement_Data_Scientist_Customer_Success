cmt_001,Hi Marie! I can help you with the login issue. Please try clearing your browser cache and cookies first. Let me know if this doesn't resolve the problem.,2024-05-20 09:30:00,False,tkt_001,usr_002,doc_002
cmt_002,Thanks Jean! I cleared the cache but still having the same issue. The login page loads but clicking Sign In just refreshes the page.,2024-05-20 10:15:00,False,tkt_001,usr_001,
cmt_003,Please try using an incognito/private browser window. This will help us determine if it's a browser extension conflict.,2024-05-20 10:20:00,False,tkt_001,usr_002,
cmt_004,That worked! I can now login in incognito mode. What should I do to fix my regular browser?,2024-05-20 10:25:00,False,tkt_001,usr_001,
cmt_005,Great! The issue is likely a browser extension interfering with authentication. Try disabling extensions one by one to identify the culprit. For now you can continue using incognito mode.,2024-05-20 10:30:00,True,tkt_001,usr_002,
cmt_006,Sarah thanks for reporting this. I can see the knowledge base has some outdated CATIA information. I'm updating it now with the latest V6 documentation.,2024-05-21 15:00:00,False,tkt_002,usr_005,
cmt_007,I've updated the knowledge base. Can you test asking the same questions now and let me know if the responses are accurate?,2024-05-21 16:30:00,False,tkt_002,usr_005,
cmt_008,Much better! Aura is now providing current V6 information. Thanks for the quick fix!,2024-05-21 17:00:00,False,tkt_002,usr_003,
cmt_009,Perfect! I'm marking this as resolved. The knowledge base has been updated with current CATIA V6 documentation.,2024-05-21 17:05:00,True,tkt_002,usr_005,doc_003
cmt_010,Thanks for the SIMULIA integration request Carlos. This is a great idea! I'm adding it to our development roadmap. We'll evaluate the technical requirements and provide an update within 2 weeks.,2024-05-22 12:00:00,False,tkt_003,usr_008,
cmt_011,Lisa I can see the performance issue you're experiencing. We're currently investigating server load during peak hours. Can you tell me what time you typically use Aura?,2024-05-23 09:00:00,False,tkt_004,usr_005,doc_009
cmt_012,Usually between 9-11 AM and 2-4 PM when our team is most active. The slowness is really impacting our work.,2024-05-23 09:15:00,False,tkt_004,usr_007,
cmt_013,Those are exactly our peak hours. I've implemented load balancing to distribute traffic better. Can you test now and let me know if performance has improved?,2024-05-23 14:00:00,False,tkt_004,usr_005,
cmt_014,Yes! Much faster now. Responses are back to normal speed. Thank you!,2024-05-23 14:30:00,False,tkt_004,usr_007,
cmt_015,Excellent! Load balancing solution has resolved the performance issue during peak hours.,2024-05-23 14:35:00,True,tkt_004,usr_005,
cmt_016,Sophie the directory service integration was temporarily down. I've restored the connection and tested employee lookup functionality. Please try again.,2024-05-24 16:45:00,True,tkt_005,usr_002,
cmt_017,Works perfectly now! I can search for employees and get their contact information. Thanks!,2024-05-24 17:00:00,False,tkt_005,usr_009,
cmt_018,Carlos I can schedule a training session for your DELMIA team. What's your preferred time and how many team members need training?,2024-05-25 11:00:00,False,tkt_006,usr_008,doc_008
cmt_019,We have 8 team members. Would next Tuesday at 2 PM work? We'd like to focus on manufacturing-specific queries.,2024-05-25 11:30:00,False,tkt_006,usr_004,
cmt_020,Perfect! I'll set up a training session for Tuesday 2 PM focusing on manufacturing workflows and DELMIA-specific questions.,2024-05-25 12:00:00,False,tkt_006,usr_008,
cmt_021,Marie I've added better entity recognition for department names. Aura should now properly understand organizational units like 'CATIA Development'. Please test and let me know!,2024-05-26 14:00:00,True,tkt_007,usr_005,
cmt_022,Great improvement! Aura now gives relevant department-specific information when I mention our team.,2024-05-26 14:30:00,False,tkt_007,usr_001,
cmt_023,Sarah I'm looking into the mobile browser issue. Can you tell me which browser and iOS version you're using?,2024-05-27 10:00:00,False,tkt_008,usr_002,doc_005
cmt_024,I'm using Safari on iOS 17.4. Chrome on mobile has the same issue.,2024-05-27 10:15:00,False,tkt_008,usr_003,
cmt_025,Lisa thanks for the voice command suggestion! This is an interesting feature that would require significant development. I'm adding it to our enhancement backlog for evaluation.,2024-05-28 16:00:00,False,tkt_009,usr_008,
cmt_026,Sophie I've identified and fixed the response truncation issue. Longer technical responses should now display completely. Can you test with a complex query?,2024-05-29 12:00:00,True,tkt_010,usr_005,
cmt_027,Working great! I asked about SIMULIA workflow integration and got a complete detailed response.,2024-05-29 12:30:00,False,tkt_010,usr_009,
cmt_028,Thomas here are the direct links to Aura documentation. I've also added these to the quick links section of the intranet.,2024-05-29 15:00:00,True,tkt_011,usr_002,doc_001
cmt_029,David the Outlook integration is a complex feature that would require API development. I'm scheduling a technical review meeting to assess feasibility.,2024-05-30 09:00:00,False,tkt_012,usr_008,doc_007
cmt_030,"According to the responses to Bug: topic set by AURA is not persistent, this will be fixed in the next patch release of the 3DSwym service.",2024-05-24 08:15:00,True,tkt_013,usr_009,
cmt_031,"thanks Marcel  

exactly the answer I was looking for.

May I ask 1 addition question (I hate people asking new question in question ðŸ¤£ ðŸ˜‰)

What will happen to existing ""New Conversation"" ?",2024-05-24 08:20:00,False,tkt_013,usr_006,
cmt_032,"The 3DSwym patch has been delivered yesterday. Based on a quick test I conclude:

cmt_033,"Kapil, interesting question. at least, if you guide (a lot) the question it lead to the correct answer.

Using the prompt with exact title of KB it works:
    in 3DEXPERIENCE, How to alphabetically sort authorized values of classification attribute using Mask Management for classified items?
Just one part of the KB title will not work:
    in 3DEXPERIENCE, How to alphabetically sort authorized values of classification attribute

It sources the correct article regardless, but not always the correct chunk. Maybe tuning the LLMâ€™s confidence threshold could help.",2024-05-29 09:15:00,False,tkt_014,usr_003,
cmt_034,"Thanks for taking time to reply in details. With some RAG knowledge, I think the right sources were retrieved, but the LLM couldnâ€™t interpret it as the right answer, maybe due to unfamiliarity with DS terminology.",2024-05-29 09:25:00,False,tkt_014,usr_010,
cmt_035,"Retrieval is done on small chunks, not the full document. The LLM might not see the right chunk even if the source shown to user seems correct. Also, the Lost in the Middle problem is unlikely here but worth noting.",2024-05-29 09:30:00,False,tkt_014,usr_005,

cmt_037,"Hello Brandon, It takes up to 5 days to replicate the new content from the public tenant to others tenant / service instances. This allows time for moderation, backup, and restore to other service instances.",2024-05-30 10:15:00,False,tkt_015,usr_009,
cmt_038,"Thanks Pierre, that covers data from the public tenant. But is it also 5 days for content within the user's own tenant? I created a document titled 'Quintiq AWS & Containers' but AURA could not find it.",2024-05-30 10:20:00,False,tkt_015,usr_007,

cmt_044,"Because AURA is mainly RAG-based, it performs a vector similarity search to retrieve documents matching your query. It then inserts these documents and your query into a predefined prompt. This rigid structure limits the model's ability to follow complex instructions unless the intent detection correctly routes it to a dedicated agent like 'chitchat'.",2024-06-02 17:40:00,False,tkt_017,usr_009,
