        "content": "It seems that Aura was providing generic answers about Catia because it wasn't properly understanding the context and terminology used in CATIA V6. \n\nTo resolve this issue, I've found a few similar tickets that have been resolved:\n\n*   A ticket where Aura's entity recognition for department names was improved, allowing it to better understand organizational units like 'CATIA Development'. \n*   Another ticket where the response truncation issue was fixed, ensuring longer technical responses display completely.\n*   Additionally, direct links to Aura documentation were provided and added to the quick links section of the intranet.\n\nTo resolve your specific issue, I recommend trying the following steps:\n\n1.  Ask a more specific question about CATIA V6 features or functionality.\n2.  Check if the latest documentation for CATIA V6 is available on the Aura documentation portal.\n3.  If you're still experiencing issues, try testing with a complex query to see if the response generation issue has been resolved.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve your issue, please let me know and I'll be happy to escalate it further.It seems that Aura was providing generic answers about Catia due to outdated information in the knowledge base. I've found a few similar tickets that have been resolved, and I'd like to help you update the knowledge base with the latest CATIA V6 documentation.\n\nTo confirm, can you please test asking Aura about specific CATIA V6 features or questions, and let me know if the responses are accurate? This will help us ensure that the updated information is reflected in the knowledge base.",
