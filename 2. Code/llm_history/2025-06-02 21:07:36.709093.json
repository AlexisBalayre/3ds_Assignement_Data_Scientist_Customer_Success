I've used the \"find_similar_tickets\" tool to search for past support tickets related to this issue. Here are some possible solutions:\n\n* Make sure you're running the latest version of CATIA V6 on your iPhone.\n* Check if your iPhone is connected to the internet, as Aura requires an active connection to function properly.\n* Try restarting the Aura app and see if that resolves the issue.\n\nIf none of these steps work, please let me know and we can try to escalate this further.I'm happy to help you with your issue with Aura on your iPhone! \n\nCan you please tell me more about the problem you're experiencing? For example, what happens when you try to access Aura on your iPhone, and what kind of error message do you see (if any)? Is it not loading at all, or is it giving you incorrect information?\n\nAlso, have you tried restarting the app or clearing its cache to see if that resolves the issue?",
