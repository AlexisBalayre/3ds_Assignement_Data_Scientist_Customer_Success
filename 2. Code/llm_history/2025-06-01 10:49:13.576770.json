        "content": "Okay, I understand \u2013 you\u2019re noticing Aura isn\u2019t providing very specific or accurate answers related to Catia, and it feels like it\u2019s giving generic responses. That\u2019s definitely frustrating! \n\nLet\u2019s troubleshoot this. It sounds like Aura isn\u2019t fully connected to the most up-to-date Catia knowledge base. \n\nHere\u2019s what we can try:\n\n1.  **Check Aura\u2019s Connection:** Aura relies on a live connection to our knowledge resources. Sometimes, there can be temporary disruptions. Let\u2019s ensure Aura has a stable connection. (I can\u2019t directly check this for you, but you can try refreshing the Aura interface \u2013 often a simple refresh button or a hard refresh with Ctrl+F5).\n\n2.  **Rephrase Your Question:** Aura\u2019s understanding is based on how you phrase your questions. Could you try rephrasing your question with more specific keywords related to the exact Catia feature or process you\u2019re asking about? For example, instead of \u201cWhy is Catia giving me an error?\u201d, try \u201cHow do I resolve a \u2018File Not Found\u2019 error in Catia V6?\u201d\n\n3.  **Narrow the Scope:** Aura might be struggling with very broad questions. Can you tell me a little more about *what* you're trying to do in Catia?  For example, are you working with:\n    *   Surface modeling?\n    *   Solid modeling?\n    *   Assembly creation?\n    *   Simulation?\n\nOnce I have a better understanding of the specific area you're working in, I can offer more targeted guidance. \n\nIf you've tried these steps and Aura is still providing generic answers, it\u2019s likely a deeper issue with the connection or the underlying knowledge base.  \n\n**I recommend filing a detailed ticket with our technical support team.**  When you do, please include:\n\n*   A description of the specific questions you\u2019ve been asking.\n*   The exact responses you\u2019re receiving from Aura.\n*   The version of Catia you're using (e.g., Catia V6, Catia V5).\n\nYou can find the link to file a ticket here: [Insert Link to Internal Ticket System Here - *This is a placeholder*]\n\nDo you mind telling me a bit more about the type of Catia task you were performing when you encountered this issue?",
