For example:\n\n* What exactly happens when you try to access Aura on your iPhone (e.g., do you get an error message, is it just not loading)?\n* Have you tried restarting the app or your device?\n* Are you using the latest version of Aura and iOS?\n\nAlso, I'd like to suggest using our \"find_similar_tickets\" tool to see if there are any similar issues that have been reported in the past. This might give us some clues about what's going on.\n\nWould you like me to guide you through the process of searching for similar tickets?",
