Can you please tell me what specifically you're trying to do in Aura with Catia? Are you trying to integrate it with another tool or feature? Or are you experiencing an issue with the integration itself?\n\nAlso, I can suggest checking the official documentation for Aura and Catia to see if there's any specific guidance on how to use them together.I'm happy to help you with the issue you're experiencing with Aura providing generic answers about Catia.\n\nIt seems that the 'find_similar_tickets' tool didn't find any relevant tickets. This could be because there aren't many similar tickets in our knowledge base or the question is quite specific.\n\nCan you please provide more context or details about what you mean by \"generic answers\" and what kind of information you're expecting Aura to provide? For example, are you looking for specific features, functionality, or tutorials related to Catia?\n\nAlso, have you tried searching for official Dassault Syst\u00e8mes documentation or resources on Catia within Aura?
