Before we dive into potential solutions, can you please tell me:\n\n* What exactly happens when you try to access Aura on your iPhone (e.g., does it crash, load slowly, or display an error message)?\n\nAlso, have you tried restarting the app or your device to see if that resolves the issue?\n\nAssuming this is a new issue for you, I'll guide you through some troubleshooting steps. Here's what we can try:\n\n1. **Check Aura's status**: Make sure Aura is not experiencing any known issues or maintenance.\n2. **Restart the app and device**: Close Aura on your iPhone, then reopen it to see if that resolves the problem.\n3. **Clear app data and cache**: Go to \"Settings\" > \"General\" > \"iPhone Storage\", find Aura in the list, and tap \"Offload App\". Then, go back to the App Store, reinstall Aura, and try again.\n4. **Check your iPhone's settings**: Ensure that Location Services and Camera are enabled for Aura (Settings > [Aura app] > Settings).\n5. **Try a different browser or device**: If possible, try accessing Aura on another device or browser to see if the issue is specific to your iPhone.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, we can explore further troubleshooting or escalate the problem to our internal support team for additional assistance.\n\nWould you like me to guide you through any of these steps?",
