        "content": "Okay, I understand. It\u2019s frustrating when Aura isn\u2019t providing the specific information you need about Catia. Let\u2019s troubleshoot this. \n\nIt seems Aura\u2019s knowledge base isn\u2019t always perfectly aligned with the latest Catia features and functionalities. \n\nHere\u2019s what we can try to get Aura working more effectively for you:\n\n1.  **Check Aura\u2019s Context:** Aura relies on the context of your current task.  Could you tell me a little more about *what* you were asking Aura to do?  For example, were you asking about a specific feature, a workflow, or a particular error message?\n\n2.  **Refine Your Query:** Sometimes, Aura interprets vague questions. Let's try being more specific. Instead of saying \"What is Catia?\", try something like: \"Can you explain the process of creating a simple part in Catia V6?\"\n\n3.  **Try a Different Approach:** Aura sometimes responds better to structured questions.  Instead of a free-form question, try breaking it down into smaller steps. \n\n4.  **Restart Aura:** Occasionally, a simple restart can refresh Aura\u2019s knowledge.  You can usually find a \"refresh\" or \"reset\" option within the Aura interface itself. \n\nIf you've tried these steps and Aura is still giving you generic answers, it\u2019s likely a limitation of the current version of the AI. \n\n**To help us investigate further, I\u2019d like to escalate this issue to our Catia AI team.** They can provide feedback to the development team about Aura\u2019s performance with Catia. \n\n**Here\u2019s how you can do that:**\n\n*   **File a Ticket:** Please go to [Internal Support Portal Link - *Replace with actual link*] and create a new ticket.  In the subject line, please include \"Aura Catia Knowledge Issues.\"\n*   **Provide Details:** In the ticket description, please briefly describe the issue you\u2019ve been experiencing (e.g., Aura giving generic answers about Catia).\n\nWe appreciate your patience as we work to improve Aura\u2019s capabilities.  Let me know if you have any other questions in the meantime.",
