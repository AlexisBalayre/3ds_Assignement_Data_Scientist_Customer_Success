This could be because Aura is a relatively new platform, and there might not be many past tickets about it yet.\n\nLet's try to start fresh! Can you please tell me more about what you're trying to do in Aura? What kind of answers are you expecting, or what problem are you trying to solve? I'll do my best to help you get the information you need.I apologize for the confusion, but it seems like I'm having trouble finding similar tickets that might help with your issue. Can you please clarify what you mean by \"generic answers about Catia\"? Are you getting responses in Aura that seem to be related to Catia, but not specifically addressing your question or issue? Or are you seeing general information about Catia being displayed?\n\nAlso, just to confirm, you're using Aura for a specific purpose and it's not related to Catia. Can you tell me more about what you're trying to do in Aura and what kind of answers you're getting that seem generic?",
