        "content": "Okay, I understand \u2013 you're noticing that Aura isn\u2019t providing very specific or helpful answers when you ask it questions about Catia. That\u2019s a common feedback we receive, and we\u2019re constantly working to improve its understanding. \n\nEssentially, Aura is still learning to deeply connect the broad concepts of Catia with the specific details you\u2019re asking about. \n\nLet\u2019s troubleshoot this. To help me understand the situation better, could you tell me:\n\n*   **What kind of questions are you asking Aura?** (e.g., \u201cHow do I create a fillet?\u201d or \u201cWhat\u2019s the best way to model a complex gear?\u201d)\n\nOnce I have a better idea of the types of questions you're posing, I can give you some targeted guidance. \n\nIn the meantime, here are a few general things that might be contributing to the issue:\n\n*   **Aura\u2019s Knowledge Base:** Aura draws its information from a vast database. Sometimes, the information in that database isn\u2019t perfectly aligned with the latest Catia versions or specific workflows.\n*   **Complex Queries:** Very complex or multi-faceted questions can be difficult for Aura to process and provide a precise answer. \n\nI\u2019ll be here to help you get the most out of Aura. Let\u2019s work together to get you the information you need!",
