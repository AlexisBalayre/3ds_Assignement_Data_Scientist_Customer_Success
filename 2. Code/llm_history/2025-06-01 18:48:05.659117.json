Can you please tell me a bit more about the context of your question or issue in Aura? For example:\n\n* What specific feature or functionality are you trying to use in Aura?\n* Are you getting these generic answers when searching for help online or within the application itself?\n\nThis will help me better understand what's going on and provide more targeted assistance.\n\nAlso, just to confirm: you're looking for information specifically about using Aura, not Catia. Is that correct?",
