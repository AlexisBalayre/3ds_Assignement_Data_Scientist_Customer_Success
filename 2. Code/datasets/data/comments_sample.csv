cmt_001,Hi Marie! I can help you with the login issue. Please try clearing your browser cache and cookies first. Let me know if this doesn't resolve the problem.,2024-05-20 09:30:00,false,tkt_001,usr_002,doc_002
cmt_002,Thanks Jean! I cleared the cache but still having the same issue. The login page loads but clicking Sign In just refreshes the page.,2024-05-20 10:15:00,false,tkt_001,usr_001,
cmt_003,Please try using an incognito/private browser window. This will help us determine if it's a browser extension conflict.,2024-05-20 10:20:00,false,tkt_001,usr_002,
cmt_004,That worked! I can now login in incognito mode. What should I do to fix my regular browser?,2024-05-20 10:25:00,false,tkt_001,usr_001,
cmt_005,Great! The issue is likely a browser extension interfering with authentication. Try disabling extensions one by one to identify the culprit. For now you can continue using incognito mode.,2024-05-20 10:30:00,true,tkt_001,usr_002,
cmt_006,Sarah thanks for reporting this. I can see the knowledge base has some outdated CATIA information. I'm updating it now with the latest V6 documentation.,2024-05-21 15:00:00,false,tkt_002,usr_005,
cmt_007,I've updated the knowledge base. Can you test asking the same questions now and let me know if the responses are accurate?,2024-05-21 16:30:00,false,tkt_002,usr_005,
cmt_008,Much better! Aura is now providing current V6 information. Thanks for the quick fix!,2024-05-21 17:00:00,false,tkt_002,usr_003,
cmt_009,Perfect! I'm marking this as resolved. The knowledge base has been updated with current CATIA V6 documentation.,2024-05-21 17:05:00,true,tkt_002,usr_005,doc_003
cmt_010,Thanks for the SIMULIA integration request Carlos. This is a great idea! I'm adding it to our development roadmap. We'll evaluate the technical requirements and provide an update within 2 weeks.,2024-05-22 12:00:00,false,tkt_003,usr_008,
cmt_011,Lisa I can see the performance issue you're experiencing. We're currently investigating server load during peak hours. Can you tell me what time you typically use Aura?,2024-05-23 09:00:00,false,tkt_004,usr_005,doc_009
cmt_012,Usually between 9-11 AM and 2-4 PM when our team is most active. The slowness is really impacting our work.,2024-05-23 09:15:00,false,tkt_004,usr_007,
cmt_013,Those are exactly our peak hours. I've implemented load balancing to distribute traffic better. Can you test now and let me know if performance has improved?,2024-05-23 14:00:00,false,tkt_004,usr_005,
cmt_014,Yes! Much faster now. Responses are back to normal speed. Thank you!,2024-05-23 14:30:00,false,tkt_004,usr_007,

cmt_017,Works perfectly now! I can search for employees and get their contact information. Thanks!,2024-05-24 17:00:00,false,tkt_005,usr_009,
cmt_018,Carlos I can schedule a training session for your DELMIA team. What's your preferred time and how many team members need training?,2024-05-25 11:00:00,false,tkt_006,usr_008,doc_008
cmt_019,We have 8 team members. Would next Tuesday at 2 PM work? We'd like to focus on manufacturing-specific queries.,2024-05-25 11:30:00,false,tkt_006,usr_004,
cmt_020,Perfect! I'll set up a training session for Tuesday 2 PM focusing on manufacturing workflows and DELMIA-specific questions.,2024-05-25 12:00:00,false,tkt_006,usr_008,
cmt_021,Marie I've added better entity recognition for department names. Aura should now properly understand organizational units like 'CATIA Development'. Please test and let me know!,2024-05-26 14:00:00,true,tkt_007,usr_005,
cmt_022,Great improvement! Aura now gives relevant department-specific information when I mention our team.,2024-05-26 14:30:00,false,tkt_007,usr_001,

cmt_025,Lisa thanks for the voice command suggestion! This is an interesting feature that would require significant development. I'm adding it to our enhancement backlog for evaluation.,2024-05-28 16:00:00,false,tkt_009,usr_008,
cmt_026,Sophie I've identified and fixed the response truncation issue. Longer technical responses should now display completely. Can you test with a complex query?,2024-05-29 12:00:00,true,tkt_010,usr_005,
cmt_027,Working great! I asked about SIMULIA workflow integration and got a complete detailed response.,2024-05-29 12:30:00,false,tkt_010,usr_009,
