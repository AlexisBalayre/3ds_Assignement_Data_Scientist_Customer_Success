# Task 1: Focused Knowledge Domain & Schema Design

## Instruction

The candidate must select a **highly specific and well-defined domain** relevant to potential customer support scenarios. The purpose is to simulate how a narrow knowledge base could be structured for efficient information retrieval.

**Examples of Suitable Domains:**

- The features and functionalities of a single software product.
- Troubleshooting procedures for a particular type of hardware issue.
- Detailed breakdown of the tiers within a specific subscription service.

Once the domain is selected, the candidate should:

1. Clearly **document the scope** and **rationale** for choosing the domain.
2. **Design a concise knowledge graph schema** within the chosen domain.
3. Explicitly define:

   - **Key entity types**
   - **Attributes of each entity**
   - **Relationships** between the entities

The schema should be well-structured and optimized for clarity, scalability, and potential use in real-world knowledge retrieval applications.

## Project Scope: Aura Support Chatbot

Aura is Dassault Syst√®mes' in-house chatbot. The aim of this project is to create a chatbot that can help users answer their questions about Aura using a knowledge base that simulates a simplified support ticket system. 

AuraHelpeskGraph can use a tool to query the knowledge base and retrieve relevant information to answer user questions. In this project, we will focus on retrieving similar tickets and their solutions based on user queries.
