# Task 2: Concise Knowledge Graph Construction

## Instruction

Using the schema defined in Task 1, the candidate should build a **small-scale but representative knowledge graph** to illustrate how the schema is applied in practice.

**Requirements:**

* Populate the graph with **5 to 10 key entities** and clearly show the **relationships** connecting them.
* The focus should be on demonstrating the **core structure and logic** of the knowledge graphâ€”not on volume or completeness.
* The implementation can use either:

  * An **in-memory structure** (e.g., Python dictionaries, lists)
  * A **lightweight graph database** (e.g., Neo4j)
