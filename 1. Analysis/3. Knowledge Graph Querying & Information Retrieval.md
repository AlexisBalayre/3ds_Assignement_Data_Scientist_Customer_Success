# Task 3: Querying the Knowledge Graph

## Instruction

The candidate should implement a **robust querying mechanism** capable of answering user questions by interacting with the knowledge graph constructed in Task 2.

**Requirements:**

* The system must be able to **interpret user queries** and **retrieve relevant information** based on the graphâ€™s structure.
* It should support **multi-hop queries**, allowing traversal across multiple entities and relationships defined in the schema.

**Optional Enhancement:**

* Integrate a **Large Language Model (LLM)** such as Llama 2 or Mistral using tools like **LangChain** or **LlamaIndex** to:

  * Interpret user intent from natural language questions
  * Identify relevant entities and relationships
  * Formulate a query or traversal strategy for the graph
